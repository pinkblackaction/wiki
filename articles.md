"A federated, decentralized, system of free associations, incorporating economic as well as social institutions, would be what I refer to as anarcho-syndicalism. And it seems to me that it is the appropriate form of social organization for an advanced technological society in which human beings do not have to be forced into the position of tools, of cogs in a machine" -Noam Chomsky

"Goebbels was in favor of free speech for views he liked. So was Stalin. If you’re really in favor of free speech, then you’re in favor of freedom of speech for precisely the views you despise. Otherwise, you’re not in favor of free speech." -Noam Chomsky

"Property is theft. Anarchy is order." Pierre-Joseph
